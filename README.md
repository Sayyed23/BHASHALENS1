## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (latest stable version recommended)
- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
- A Firebase project with Authentication enabled.
- A Google Cloud project with Gemini API access.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-actual-username/bhashalens.git
    cd bhashalens    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Environment Setup:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Gemini API Key:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
    # Optional: OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```

4.  **Firebase Setup:**
    - **Android:** Place your `google-services.json` file in `android/app/`.
    - **iOS:** Place your `GoogleService-Info.plist` file in `ios/Runner/`.

5.  **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## 🔐 Credentials & Security

- **API Keys:** The Gemini API key is securely managed using `flutter_dotenv`. Ensure you do not commit your `.env` file to version control.
- **Authentication:** User authentication is handled via Firebase, ensuring secure login and data protection.

## 📱 Platforms

- **Android:** Fully supported.
- **iOS:** Fully supported (requires valid code signing).
- **Web:** Beta Support.
  - *Note:* Ensure your `.env` file contains `FIREBASE_WEB_...` keys.
  - *Note:* SQLite is not supported on Web; the app uses a fallback (no-op) implementation for `LocalStorageService` to prevent crashes.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **App Stuck on Splash Screen (Android)**
   - Check if you have blocking `await` calls in `main()`. Initialization should be in `initState`.

2. **White Screen on Web**
   - Verify `.env` configuration.
   - Check for incompatible packages like `tflite_flutter` or `sqflite` in the web build.

3. **"Service Not Ready" / Translation Not Working**
   - Check if your API Key is correctly set in `.env` and loaded in Settings.
   - Verify internet connection.
   - Ensure the API key has quota available.

4. **Speech Recognition Fails**
   - Ensure microphone permissions are granted.
   - Try speaking more clearly or closer to the microphone.

5. **"No Text Detected" in Camera Mode**
   - Ensure good lighting and clear text.
   - Try re-orienting the camera.

### Debugging
- Check the debug console for logs. We use `debugPrint` for essential logs regarding API responses and initialization errors.
